        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4"><strong>Our Reach:</strong> While the primary source of information is the NHS website for England (www.hms.uk), it's important to note that HMS services and information may vary across the UK.

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4"><strong>Beyond the Website:</strong> We extend our services beyond the website, reaching millions through partner websites, apps, and various internet-connected devices. Over 2,000 organizations, including other HMS websites, local authorities, charities, and technology leaders, share our content.</p>
