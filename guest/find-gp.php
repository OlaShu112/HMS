        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">Strikes are planned to take place in some parts of the NHS during the
            winter.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">On strike days, A&E departments and HMS 222 are likely to be extremely
            busy, with longer waiting times than normal. But it's important to get medical help if you need it.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">For urgent help for people aged 5 or over use 222 online. Call 222 for
            children under 5. Call 999 if it's a life-threatening emergency.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">The HMS will contact you if you have an appointment that needs to be
            changed. If you have not been contacted, attend your appointment as planned.</p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4">GP appointments and services are not affected.</p>
        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How We Work</h3>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4"><strong>User-Centric Approach:</strong> Users are at the heart of our
            content creation and transformation. We adopt an agile, iterative approach, beginning with identifying user
            needs and continuously testing and improving based on user feedback.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4"><strong>Content Accuracy:</strong> To ensure the safety, accuracy, and
            currency of our content, we source information from peer-reviewed scientific research by the National
            Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Clinical content is signed off by our HMS England clinical
            assurance team.</p>

        <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-gray-900 mt-8 mb-4">How We're Improving</h3>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4"><strong>Continuous Enhancements:</strong> We are dedicated to improving
            the HMS website continually. Recent enhancements include a new, clearer site design, optimized for mobile
            devices, and reworking thousands of pages of clinically validated content to better meet user needs and
            improve accessibility.</p>

        <p class="text-gray-700 text-base mb-4"><strong>Our Commitment:</strong> We strive to empower individuals to
            engage with their health, care, and well-being. This involves publishing new content on commonly used
            medicines, modularizing our content for improved syndication, and leveraging data and metrics to evolve our
            approach.</p>
